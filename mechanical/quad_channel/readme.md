# Mechanical design for quad channel commutator

Design by the Francis Crick Making lab
https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/Making-Lab-Repositories

This has been tested with the Spinner BN 153266C4001. 

Warnings: 
- BN 153266C4001 comes with long SMA cables on the rotating side of the commutator 
(facing down in this design) and is adapted only if the commutator is >2m above the 
arena (BN 153266C400**0** might be more adapted to smaller setups).
- The gear a design is modified from initial design to have a circular aperture 
(because of the stepper we happened to have) but is the same otherwise. The D-shaped
aperture from the single channel version is likely to be preferable in all other
circumstances
