# Cris
1. The slip ring holes should be 10-32 tap holes
2. 10-32 bolt must not extend below bottom (<=8mm long)
3. Slip ring gear inner hole too small: should be 7.8mm
4. The big square hole for the motor wires to come through should be expanded to 24x50mm
5. There are two 1/4-20 mount holes that are blocked by the motor.
6. Should the motor just be covered by the case?
7. Motor gear hole too small. 4.9mm diameter -> 5.1 mm diamter hole for tolerance
8. Thin down the wall where the teensy PCB contacts the wall of the enclosure.
9. The USB hole is the correct size but not the correct location.
10. Move the rib further from the teensy its basically touching it right nwo.
11. Reset button hole is in slightly wrong position. Also, the holes height can be reduced by 1.5 mm.
12. Mor thickness on back plate (screws holding pcb are too close to surface). At least 1mm.
13. Because there is very little to align to on the rotor shaft of this slip ring, make the gear with a flange to give it more of a shaft to align on. 


# Orbex
1. Orbex: dont put shrink tube on the lower part of the slip ring.
2. Orbex: some pairs should be twisted.
3. Orbex: what is the tolerance for the rotor angle relative to the stator?
